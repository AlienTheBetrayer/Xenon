## About
**Xenon** is a library that has all the stuff you need. It is multi-faceted, it consists of many modules that serve different functionality.
## Getting started
Xenon is untested on other compilers except MSVC so it is recommended to use it.

Start by cloning or downloading this repository, placing the **xenon** folder in your project and do `#include "xenon/xenon.hpp"` or something similar.
